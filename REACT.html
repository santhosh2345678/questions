<h1>1.)use of context</h1>
<p>Context is used in React to share data between components without prop drilling, creating a global state accessible to all nested components within a tree.
</p>

<h1>2.)use context and use Reducer</h1>
<p> useContext - a react hook, allowing functional components to take advantage of the context API.</p>
<h1>3.)How to update state in context</h1>
<P>To update state in context, use the `useState` hook within the context provider component and provide a function to update the state.
</p>

<h1>4.)What is create context? write it purpose</h1>
<p>createContext` is a function in React used to create a context object, which helps in sharing state and data across components efficiently.
</p>


<h1>5.)context.provider and context.consumer</h1>
<p>Context allows components to access shared data, the provider sets the context's value, and the consumer consumes it within nested components.</p>


<h1>6.)differentate between Redux and context</h1>
<p>Redux is a state management library, while Context is a feature in React for sharing state locally. Redux is more suitable for complex applications.
</p>


<h1>7.)purpose of useSelector and usedispatch hook</h1>
<p>`useSelector` is for accessing specific parts of Redux store state, and `useDispatch` is used to dispatch actions in React Redux.</p>


<h1>8.)use of fragment</h1>
<p> Fragments in React allow grouping multiple elements without introducing extra parent divs in the DOM.</p>


<h1>9.)What is store in reducx</h1>
<p> In Redux, a store is a centralized place to store application state.</p>

<h1>10.)How to read initial state and reducer fun in reducx</h1>
<p></p>

<h1>11.)What is scss and uses</h1>
<p> Initial state is defined when creating a Redux store, and the reducer function specifies how state changes in response to actions.</p>

<h1>12.)differente between scss and css</h1>
<p>SCSS is a preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables and nesting, making stylesheets more modular and maintainable compared to traditional CSS.</p>

<h1>13.)Why we go for lifecycle</h1>
<p>Lifecycle methods in React allow you to perform actions at specific stages of a component's life, like componentDidMount for initial setup.</p>


<h1>14.)Which one is better reducx or context give reason</h1>
<p>The choice between Redux and Context depends on the project's complexity; Redux is better for larger, more complex applications, while Context is simpler and suitable for smaller ones.</P>


<h1>15.)How many Slice created in reducx and how many store created in reducx </h1>
<p>Redux can have multiple slices for different parts of the state, but typically, there's one store for the entire application.</P>
